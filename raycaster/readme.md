-Progressed on the "3D" rendering. Side-by-side viewports now implemented.</br>
-Issue to be fixed: fish-eye effect. Also distances seem a bit off.
-To be added: the camera can move forwards/backwards but only the viewport turns (the camera stays on the same Y-axis).

-Code cleaned up</br>
-Now handle 360 rays</br>
