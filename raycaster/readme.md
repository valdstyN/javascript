-Implemented system to move both in x and y based on view angle (not working quite right but good enough for testing at the moment)</br>
-Added a createBlock function to draw 4 segments at once</br>
-Improved a bit the rendering</br>

-Added a player that can move up and down.</br>
-Rays are only projected for a limited viewscope.</br>
-Progressed on the "3D" rendering. Side-by-side viewports now implemented.</br>
-Issue to be fixed: fish-eye effect. Also distances seem a bit off.</br>
-To be added: the camera can move forwards/backwards but only the viewport turns (the camera stays on the same Y-axis).</br>

-1st draft of ray caster.</br>
-The script only draws two randoms lines (walls) and projects a couple of rays (not 360).</br>
-Next step is to define a viewscope and renders a 1st person view.</br>
-Project went dormant</br>
