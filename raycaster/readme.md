-Added a player that can move up and down.</br>
-Rays are only projected for a limited viewscope.</br>
-Progressed on the "3D" rendering. Side-by-side viewports now implemented.</br>
-Issue to be fixed: fish-eye effect. Also distances seem a bit off.
-To be added: the camera can move forwards/backwards but only the viewport turns (the camera stays on the same Y-axis).
